    Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written
    in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC)
    framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and
    web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as
    JSON or XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user
    interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other
    well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention
    over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record
    pattern.[4] Ruby on Rails' emergence in 2005 greatly influenced web app
    development, through innovative features such as seamless database table
    creations, migrations, and scaffolding of views to enable rapid application
    development. Ruby on Rails' influence on other web frameworks remains
    apparent today, with many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas,
    including Django in Python; Catalyst in Perl; Laravel, CakePHP and Yii in
    PHP; Grails in Groovy; Phoenix in Elixir; Play in Scala; and Sails.js in
    Node.js. Well-known sites that use Ruby on Rails include Airbnb, Bloomberg,
    Crunchbase, Dribbble,[5] GitHub[6] and Shopify.
